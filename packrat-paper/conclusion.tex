In this paper, we describe and evaluate the \Sys protocol for sending
network-originated retransmissions when the end-to-end transport is encrypted.
We use set-reconciliation techniques
based on the Rateless IBLT to let the receiver efficiently acknowledge
encrypted packets, yielding performance benefits in lossy settings
without an additional layer of encapsulation, tunnel, or link-layer
retransmissions.
