This paper describes and evaluates new techniques for
network-originated retransmissions for end-to-end transport
connections, yielding performance benefits for encrypted transport
protocols in lossy settings.  We use set-reconciliation techniques
based on the Rateless IBLT to let the receiver efficiently acknowledge
encrypted packets to a network function, without modifying the sender
or the underlying wire format. With these tools, endpoints can receive
network-originated retransmissions appropriate for them, without an
additional layer of encapsulation, tunnel, or link-layer
retransmissions.
