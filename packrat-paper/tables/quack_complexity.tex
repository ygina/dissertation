    \caption{The computational complexity of the encoding and decoding
    operations of each type of eACK, and the number of symbols. The IBLT
    is theoretically better or the same in all regards, but it
    incurs constant overheads in the size and in hashing.
    $N$ is the number of packets at the proxy, $m < N$ is the number of
     missing packets, and $t$ is the number of symbols.}
