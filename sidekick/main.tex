\chapter[Sidekick Protocols]{Sidekick Protocols: Secure in-network assistance for data senders}
\label{sec:sidekick}

This chapter describes \emph{Sidekick protocols}: an approach to in-network
assistance for secure transport protocols. In this approach, in-network
intermediaries help endpoints by sending information adjacent to the underlying
connection, which remains opaque and unmodified on the wire. Described in \Cref
{sec:quack}, this information is called a quACK, and the quACK is the key
technical tool that allows proxies to usefully refer to a set of packets that
they have received even when the transport headers are randomly encrypted. In
real-world and emulation-based evaluations, the Sidekick protocol improves
performance in several scenarios: early retransmission over lossy Wi-Fi paths,
proxy acknowledgments to save energy, and a path-aware congestion-control
mechanism we call \emph{PACUBIC}. The path-aware CUBIC congestion control
algorithm emulates the congestion response of a ``split'' connection from the
perspective of the data sender at the endpoint, without buffering packets at
the proxy.
