\chapter{Sidekick Protocol}
\label{sec:sidekick}

In response to concerns about protocol ossification and privacy, post-TCP
transport protocols such as QUIC and Web\-RTC include end-to-end encryption and
authentication at the transport layer. This makes their packets opaque to
middleboxes, freeing the transport protocol to evolve but preventing some
in-network innovations and performance improvements. This chapter describes
\emph{Sidekick protocols}: an approach to in-network assistance for opaque
transport protocols where in-network intermediaries help endpoints by sending
information adjacent to the underlying connection, which remains opaque and
unmodified on the wire.

In real-world and emulation-based evaluations, the Sidekick protocol improves
performance in several scenarios: early retransmission over lossy Wi-Fi paths,
proxy acknowledgments to save energy, and a path-aware congestion-control
mechanism we call \emph{PACUBIC} that emulates a ``split'' connection.
