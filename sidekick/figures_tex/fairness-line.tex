\caption{Connection-splitting PEP emulation as a function of near-segment
	loss rate. In this emulation experiment, QUIC+Sidekick (running PACUBIC)
  performs similarly to TCP+PEP (each connection running CUBIC)
  and improves goodput compared with end-to-end protocols. The graph shows
  median goodput of a 10~MByte upload. QuACK interval is 30~ms, threshold
is 10. Error bars show IQR of 10 trials.
