\caption{The encoding time of the power sum quACK scales linearly with the
 threshold $t$, and is generally higher for higher bit widths. If expect the
 typical threshold to be $<100$, then the typical encoding time is on the order
 of nanoseconds per packet. Average of 100
 trials, each trial is the average of 1000 packets.}
