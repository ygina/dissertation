Other measurement studies characterize the existence of PEPs, mostly harmful
ones. It is challenging to measure the benefits in the wild due to the
transparent nature of the proxies and because of varying network conditions.
One could run an encrypted transport protocol alongside TCP, but that adds
confounding factors such as the implementation of the protocol. Even with this,
some TCP PEP deployments, such as in satellite networks, will ban unknown
protocols completely due to their known performance issues. This emulation
study provides a characterization of the real world.

While PEPs have been used to improve performance, their application to encrypted
transport protocols such as QUIC is an area of active research. Snoop, Zombie,
Sidekick. Applied to specific scenarios and none as generalizable as the
connection-splitting TCP PEP. PEP-DNA.
