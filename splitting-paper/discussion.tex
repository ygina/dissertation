Another is thinking about future implications for encrypted transport protocols.
As transport protocols like QUIC develop is it bad if we can't split their
connections given how much performance can benefit?

Fairness, discussion on while ISPs have deployed these there hasn't been much
analysis into its fairness. In particular, relative to end-to-end congestion
control algorithms.
It is known that connection-splitting PEPs improve performance for that
connection, but what is the implication of its performance on competing flows?
But how much bandwidth does it save by reducing retransmissions by buffering at
the proxy?
