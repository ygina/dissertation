    \caption{An overview of the Sidekick protocol approach to in-network
    assistance. In this diagram, the client is connected to the server
    via a lossy link to the proxy. The client and proxy speak the Sidekick
    protocol on an adjacent connection to the end-to-end connection between
    the client and server speaking the base protocol. QuACKs are exchanged
    over the Sidekick protocol, and the proxy also maintains a Packrat cache
    of packets for potential retransmission.}
