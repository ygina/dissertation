     represent scenarios with loss near the data receiver where the proxy is
     located behind a Wi-Fi access point, LEO satellite ground station, and
     cellular base station, respectively. The number of symbols is configured
     for the IBLT quACK, which in practice sends only a short prefix of symbols
     over the wire.
