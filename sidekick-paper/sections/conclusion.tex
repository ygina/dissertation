\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented \emph{\sys protocols}: an alternate approach to PEPs that leaves
the underlying protocol opaque and unmodified on the wire.
We described a mathematical technique called a \emph{quACK} that enables
middleboxes to refer to packets of the underlying connection without the ability
to observe cleartext sequence numbers.
We augmented a streaming protocol and a production QUIC implementation
(Cloudflare quiche)
to make use of information arriving from a proxy on a \sys connection,
including a path-aware congestion-control mechanism called \emph{PACUBIC}.
In emulation and a real-world evaluation, the \sys protocol
was able to improve the
performance---tail latency, throughput, or energy usage---of these
end-to-end base protocols without modifying the wire format or security properties.
