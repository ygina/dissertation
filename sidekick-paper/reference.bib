ABC is designed to rapidly acquire any capacity that opens up, a common occurrence in cellular networks, while responding promptly to congestion. It is also incrementally deployable using existing ECN infrastructure and can co-exist with legacy ECN routers.

We propose a research agenda towards an alternate approach to PEPs, creating a sidecar protocol that is loosely-coupled to the unchanged and opaque, underlying transport protocol. The key technical challenge to sidecar protocols is how to usefully refer to the packets of the underlying connection without ossification. We have made progress on this problem by creating a tool we call a quACK (quick ACK), a concise representation of a multiset of numbers that can be used to efficiently decode the randomly-encrypted packet contents a sidecar has received. We implement the quACK and discuss how to achieve several applications with this approach: alternate congestion control, ACK reduction, and PEP-to-PEP retransmission across a lossy subpath.},

abstract = {P4 is a high-level language for programming protocol-independent packet processors. P4 works in conjunction with SDN control protocols like OpenFlow. In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol headers on which it operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in a few years, increasing the complexity of the specification while still not providing the flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers should be able to describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.},

abstract = {Many network middleboxes perform deep packet inspection (DPI), a set of useful tasks which examine packet payloads. These tasks include intrusion detection (IDS), exfiltration detection, and parental filtering. However, a long-standing issue is that once packets are sent over HTTPS, middleboxes can no longer accomplish their tasks because the payloads are encrypted. Hence, one is faced with the choice of only one of two desirable properties: the functionality of middleboxes and the privacy of encryption. We propose BlindBox, the first system that simultaneously provides {em both} of these properties. The approach of BlindBox is to perform the deep-packet inspection {em directly} on the encrypted traffic. BlindBox realizes this approach through a new protocol and new encryption schemes.We demonstrate that BlindBox enables applications such as IDS, exfiltration detection and parental filtering, and supports real rulesets from both open-source and industrial DPI systems. We implemented BlindBox and showed that it is practical for settings with long-lived HTTPS connections. Moreover, its core encryption scheme is 3-6 orders of magnitude faster than existing relevant cryptographic schemes.},

abstract = {Multi-tenant datacenters are successful because tenants can seamlessly port their applications and services to the cloud. Virtual Machine (VM) technology plays an integral role in this success by enabling a diverse set of software to be run on a unified underlying framework. This flexibility, however, comes at the cost of dealing with out-dated, inefficient, or misconfigured TCP stacks implemented in the VMs. This paper investigates if administrators can take control of a VM's TCP congestion control algorithm without making changes to the VM or network hardware. We propose AC/DC TCP, a scheme that exerts fine-grained control over arbitrary tenant TCP stacks by enforcing per-flow congestion control in the virtual switch (vSwitch). Our scheme is light-weight, flexible, scalable and can police non-conforming flows. In our evaluation the computational overhead of AC/DC TCP is less than one percentage point and we show implementing an administrator-defined congestion control algorithm in the vSwitch (i.e., DCTCP) closely tracks its native performance, regardless of the VM's TCP stack.},

abstract = {New congestion control algorithms are rapidly improving datacenters by reducing latency, overcoming incast, increasing throughput and improving fairness. Ideally, the operating system in every server and virtual machine is updated to support new congestion control algorithms. However, legacy applications often cannot be upgraded to a new operating system version, which means the advances are off-limits to them. Worse, as we show, legacy applications can be squeezed out, which in the worst case prevents the entire network from adopting new algorithms.Our goal is to make it easy to deploy new and improved congestion control algorithms into multitenant datacenters, without having to worry about TCP-friendliness with non-participating virtual machines. This paper presents a solution we call virtualized congestion control. The datacenter owner may introduce a new congestion control algorithm in the hypervisors. Internally, the hypervisors translate between the new congestion control algorithm and the old legacy congestion control, allowing legacy applications to enjoy the benefits of the new algorithm. We have implemented proof-of-concept systems for virtualized congestion control in the Linux kernel and in VMware's ESXi hypervisor, achieving improved fairness, performance, and control over guest bandwidth allocations.},

abstract = {The shared nature of the wireless medium induces contention between data transport and backward signaling, such as acknowledgement. The current way of TCP acknowledgment induces control overhead which is counter-productive for TCP performance especially in wireless local area network (WLAN) scenarios.In this paper, we present a new acknowledgement called TACK ("Tame ACK"), as well as its TCP implementation TCP-TACK. TCP-TACK works on top of commodity WLAN, delivering high wireless transport goodput with minimal control overhead in the form of ACKs, without any hardware modification. To minimize ACK frequency, TACK abandons the legacy received-packet-driven ACK. Instead, it balances byte-counting ACK and periodic ACK so as to achieve a controlled ACK frequency. Evaluation results show that TCP-TACK achieves significant advantages over legacy TCP in WLAN scenarios due to less contention between data packets and ACKs. Specifically, TCP-TACK reduces over 90\% of ACKs and also obtains an improvement of ~ 28\% on good-put. We further find it performs equally well as high-speed TCP variants in wide area network (WAN) scenarios, this is attributed to the advancements of the TACK-based protocol design in loss recovery, round-trip timing, and send rate control.},

Retina supports running arbitrary user-defined analysis functions on a wide variety of extensible data representations ranging from raw packets to parsed application-layer handshakes. We introduce a novel filtering mechanism and subscription interface to safely and efficiently process high-speed traffic. Under the hood, Retina implements an efficient data pipeline that strategically discards unneeded traffic and defers expensive processing operations to preserve computation for complex analyses. We present the framework architecture, evaluate its performance on production traffic, and explore several applications. Our experiments show that Retina is capable of running sophisticated analyses at over 100 Gbps on a single commodity server and can support 5--100\texttimes{} higher traffic rates than existing solutions, dramatically reducing the effort to complete investigations on real-world networks.},

It can replace the traditional HTTP/TLS/TCP stack and the IETF has chartered a working group to standardize it. QUIC encrypts all data and most protocol headers to prevent interferences from middleboxes.Motivated by the success of Multipath TCP (MPTCP), we design Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC), a QUIC extension that enables a QUIC connection to use different paths such as WiFi and LTE on smartphones, or IPv4 and IPv6 on dual-stack hosts. We implement MPQUIC as an extension of the quic-go implementation. We evaluate the benefits of QUIC and MPQUIC by comparing them with TCP and MPTCP in a variety of settings. MPQUIC maintains MPTCP's benefits (aggregation benefit, network handover). Without packet losses, while performance of single-path TCP and single-path QUIC are similar, MPQUIC can outperform MPTCP. In lossy scenarios, (MP)QUIC is more suited than (MP)TCP.},

traditional networks made up of links with low bit-error rates.
Networks with higher bit-error rates, such as those with wireless
links and mobile hosts, violate many of the assumptions made by
TCP, causing degraded end-to-end performance. In tbis paper, we
describe the design and implementation of a simple protocol, called
the snoop protocol, that improves TCP performance in wireless
networks. The protocol modifies network-layer software mainly at a
base station and preserves end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea
of the protocol is to cache packets at the base station and perform
local retransmissions across the wireless link. We have implemented
the snoop protocol on a wireless testbed consisting of IBM ThinkPad
laptops and i486 base stations communicating over an AT&T
Wavelan. Our experiments show that it is significantly more robust
at dealing with unreliable wireless links as compared to normal
TCP; we have achieved throughput speedups of up to 20 times over
regular TCP in our experiments with the protocol.},

abstract = {Many versions of Unix provide facilities for user-level packet capture, making possible the use of general purpose workstations for network monitoring. Because network monitors run as user-level processes, packets must be copied across the kernel/user-space protection boundary. This copying can be minimized by deploying a kernel agent called a packet filter, which discards unwanted packets as early as possible. The original Unix packet filter was designed around a stack-based filter evaluator that performs sub-optimally on current RISC CPUs. The BSD Packet Filter (BPF) uses a new, register-based filter evaluator that is up to 20 times faster than the original design. BPF alson uses a straighforward buffering strategy that makes its overall performance up to 100 times faster than Sun's NIT running on the same hardware.},

abstract = {CUBIC is a congestion control protocol for TCP (transmission control protocol) and the current default TCP algorithm in Linux. The protocol modifies the linear window growth function of existing TCP standards to be a cubic function in order to improve the scalability of TCP over fast and long distance networks. It also achieves more equitable bandwidth allocations among flows with different RTTs (round trip times) by making the window growth to be independent of RTT -- thus those flows grow their congestion window at the same rate. During steady state, CUBIC increases the window size aggressively when the window is far from the saturation point, and the slowly when it is close to the saturation point. This feature allows CUBIC to be very scalable when the bandwidth and delay product of the network is large, and at the same time, be highly stable and also fair to standard TCP flows. The implementation of CUBIC in Linux has gone through several upgrades. This paper documents its design, implementation, performance and evolution as the default TCP algorithm of Linux.},

In most existing standards, reliable transmission on the wireless medium is achieved through the introduction of ARQ schemes at MAC layer, a strategy which is also employed by TCP for reliable end-to-end data delivery. The paper proposes an approach to overcome the performance degradation deriving from the duplicate ARQ strategies implemented at the transport and MAC layers by introducing a cross-layer solution to reduce un-necessary transmissions on the wireless medium. Furthermore, the paper describes how the proposed scheme, called ARQ Proxy, can be deployed in three different wireless technologies (3G Long-Term Evolution, Wi-Fi, and WiMAX) and provides extensive validation of the achievable improvement through simulations.

abstract = {In this paper, we study the straggler identification problem, in which an algorithm must determine the identities of the remaining members of a set after it has had a large number of insertion and deletion operations performed on it, and now has relatively few remaining members. The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n is the total number of identities. Straggler identification has applications, for example, in determining the unacknowledged packets in a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We provide a deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem that uses only O(dlog n) bits, based on a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials. This solution can identify any subset of d stragglers from a set of n O(log n)-bit identifiers, assuming that there are no false deletions of identities not already in the set. Indeed, we give a lower bound argument that shows that any small-space deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem cannot be guaranteed to handle false deletions. Nevertheless, we provide a simple randomized solution, using O(dlog nlog (1/epsilon )) bits that can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification problem, tolerating false deletions, where epsilon >0 is a user-defined parameter bounding the probability of an incorrect response. This randomized solution is based on a new type of Bloom filter, which we call the invertible Bloom filter.},

Meanwhile, TCP is still only single-path.Is it possible to extend TCP to enable it to support multiple paths for current applications on today's Internet? The answer is positive. We carefully review the constraints--partly due to various types of middleboxes-- that influenced the design of Multipath TCP and show how we handled them to achieve its deployability goals.We report our experience in implementing Multipath TCP in the Linux kernel and we evaluate its performance. Our measurements focus on the algorithms needed to efficiently use paths with different characteristics, notably send and receive buffer tuning and segment reordering. We also compare the performance of our implementation with regular TCP on web servers. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from designing MPTCP.},

abstract = {The end-to-end nature of today's transport protocols is increasingly being questioned by the growing heterogeneity of networks and devices, and the need to support in-network services. To address these challenges, we present Tapa, a transport architecture that systematically combines two concepts. First, it unbundles today's transport such that network specific functions (e.g., congestion control) are implemented on a per-segment basis, where a segment spans a part of the end-to-end path that is homogeneous (e.g., wired Internet or an access network) while functions that relate to application semantics (e.g., data ordering) are still implemented end-to-end. Second, it has an explicit notion of in-network services (e.g., caching, opportunistic content retrieval, etc) that can be supported while maintaining precise end-to-end application semantics. In this paper, we present the basic design, implementation and evaluation of Tapa. We also present diverse case studies that show how Tapa can easily support opportunistic content retrieval in online social networks, various mobile and wireless optimizations, and an in-network energy saving service that improves battery life of mobile devices.},

abstract = {Satellite broadband connectivity has received significant level of interest in recent years, partly due to the emergence of 5th and 6th generations of cellular networks and their novel use-cases. High-throughput GEO satellites are therefore expected to become an integral part of such networks both for access and backhauling. Almost simultaneously, major breakthroughs have occurred within the Internet transport layer - i.e., with the increasing deployment of user-space QUIC protocol and BBR congestion control. The impact of these innovations and their overall performance on the Internet paths traversing over satellite links is yet to be investigated. Although traditionally TCP-splitting methods with Performance-Enhancing-Proxies (PEPs) were used to boost the transport performance over the satellite links, such approaches become hard for QUIC due to its encrypted nature. This leads to QUIC's poor performance over satellite links, which is currently being investigated by the IETF's QUIC WG. In addition, the transport performance depends on the choice of congestion control and QUIC implementation. In this work we will explore these aspects and the suitability of BBR congestion control for QUIC over SATCOM networks through real-life experimentation in an emulated testbed environment.},

abstract = {We've known for a while that the Internet has ossified as a result of the race to optimize existing applications or enhance security. NATs, performance-enhancing-proxies,firewalls and traffic normalizers are only a few of the middleboxes that are deployed in the network and look beyond the IP header to do their job. IP itself can't be extended because "IP options are not an option". Is the same true for TCP?In this paper we develop a measurement methodology for evaluating middlebox behavior relating to TCP extensions and present the results of measurements conducted from multiple vantage points. The short answer is that we can still extend TCP, but extensions' design is very constrained as it needs to take into account prevalent middlebox behaviors. For instance, absolute sequence numbers cannot be embedded in options, as middleboxes can rewrite ISN and preserve undefined options. Sequence numbering also must be consistent for a TCP connection, because many middleboxes only allow through contiguous flows.We used these findings to analyze three proposed extensions to TCP. We find that MPTCP is likely to work correctly in the Internet or fallback to regular TCP. TcpCrypt seems ready to be deployed, however it is fragile if resegmentation does happen---for instance with hardware offload. Finally, TCP extended options in its current form is not safe to deploy.},

abstract = {After nearly five years and 34 draft versions, standardization of the new connection oriented transport protocol QUIC was finalized in May 2021. Designed as a fundamental network protocol with increased complexity due to the combination of functionality from multiple network stack layers, it has the potential to drastically influence the Internet ecosystem. Nevertheless, even in its early stages, the protocol attracted a variety of parties including large providers. Our study shows, that more than 2.3 M IPv4 and 300k IPv6 addresses support QUIC hosting more than 30 M domains.Using our newly implemented stateful QUIC scanner (QScanner) we are able to successfully scan 26 M targets. We show that TLS as an integral part is similarly configured between QUIC and TLS over TCP stacks for the same target. In comparison, we identify 45 widely varying transport parameter configurations, e.g., with differences in the order of magnitudes for performance relevant parameters. Combining these configurations with HTTP Server header values and associated domains reveals two large edge deployments from Facebook and Google. Thus, while found QUIC deployments are located in 4667 autonomous systems, numerous of these are again operated by large providers.In our experience, IETF QUIC already sees an advanced deployment status mainly driven by large providers. We argue that the current deployment state and diversity of existing implementations and seen configurations solidifies the importance of QUIC as a future research topic. In this work, we provide and evaluate a versatile tool set, to identify QUIC capable hosts and their properties.Besides the stateful QScanner we present and analyze a newly implemented IPv4 and IPv6 ZMap module. We compare it to additional detection methods based on HTTP Alternative Service Header values from HTTP handshakes and DNS scans of the newly drafted HTTPS DNS resource record. While each method reveals unique deployments the latter would allow lightweight scans to detect QUIC capable targets but is drastically biased towards Cloudflare.},
